Through the COMMUNITY BASED SCHOLARS pillar, we finance all necessary school materials, compulsory uniforms, and school and travel expenses. What's more, during school hours, our HAYAG girls give these children tutoring every Saturday in the project house, and even daily during the holidays. The children are very interested in the material they are learning. They feel that they are being given a chance at a better life, one that they can take a step closer to with the help of Hauz HAYAG.</p>
